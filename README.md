## Instructions

This is a collection of some stickers I like in Telegram and are not available in the iOS yet.

Basically this is the example App from WhatsApp, with minimal changes.

Just checkout, open on XCode and run on your iPhone, you don't need a Developer Account to run on your iPhone, just follow the instructions on [Deploying to a Device without an Apple Developer Account](https://blog.ionicframework.com/deploying-to-a-device-without-an-apple-developer-account/).

There is a script `downloadTelegramStickersPack.js` with instructions on how to download a Telegram Stickers Pack.
